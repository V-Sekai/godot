libriscv emulator CLI
============================================

This folder contains a small subproject that enables using libriscv to run RISC-V programs directly from the terminal. A command-line interface using libriscv, if you will.

* [Usage](#usage)
* [Debugging](#debugging)
* [Binary translation](#binary-translation)

## Usage

```sh
bash build.sh
$ ./rvlinux ../tests/unit/elf/zig-riscv64-hello-world 
Hello, world!
>>> Program exited, exit code = 0 (0x0)
Instructions executed: 6980  Runtime: 0.033ms  Insn/s: 214mi/s
Pages in use: 87 (348 kB virtual memory, total 1714 kB)
```

The CLI comes with a few commandline options:

```sh
$ ./rvlinux --help
Usage: ./rvlinux [options] <program> [args]
Options:
  -h, --help         Print this help message
  -v, --verbose      Enable verbose loader output
  -d, --debug        Enable CLI debugger
  -f, --fuel         Set max instructions until program halts
  -g, --gdb          Start GDB server on port 2159
  -s, --silent       Suppress program completion information
  -t, --timing       Enable timing information in binary translator
  -T, --trace        Enable tracing in binary translator
  -n, --no-translate Disable binary translation
  -m, --mingw        Cross-compile for Windows (MinGW)
  -F, --from-start   Start debugger from the beginning (_start)
  -S  --sandbox      Enable strict sandbox
```

In order to use the CLI you will need some RISC-V programs. There are a few ready-to-run programs in the [tests/unit/elf](/tests/unit/elf) folder. These are part of the automated tests for the emulator.

If you are looking for the internals of the RISC-V emulator, that is in the [library folder](/lib/libriscv/). If you want to use it as a library, then that is shown in the [examples folder](/examples).

## Debugging

For debugging instructions one by one, use `--debug`:

```
$ ./rvlinux --debug ../tests/unit/elf/newlib-rv32gb-hello-world 

*
* Entered main() @ 0x10670
*

>>> Breakpoint 	[00010670] E9010113 ADDI SP, SP-368 (0x11A1E80)

[RA	000113D8] [SP	011A1E80] [GP	000A09F0] [TP	00000000] 
[LR	7F7F7FFF] [TMP1	00000002] [TMP2	FFFFFFFF] [SR0	00000000] [SR1	00000000] 
[A0	00000001] [A1	011A1E84] [A2	00000000] [A3	0000003E] [A4	FF0A0000] 
[A5	00011360] [A6	00000020] [A7	000A1E4C] [SR2	00000000] [SR3	00000000] 
[SR4	00000000] [SR5	00000000] [SR6	00000000] [SR7	00000000] [SR8	00000000] 
[SR9	00000000] [SR10	00000000] [SR11	00000000] [TMP3	00000000] [TMP4	00000000] 
[TMP5	00000000] [TMP6	00000000] [MEM PAGES          148]
Enter = cont, help, quit: 
```

Will let you step through the program instruction by instruction. By default it stops just after entering `main()`, if the function is found. If you want to prevent that, there is the `--from-start` option.

For remote debugging with GDB, use `--gdb`:

```
$ ./rvlinux --gdb ../tests/unit/elf/newlib-rv32gb-hello-world 
GDB server is listening on localhost:2159

...

$ gdb-multiarch newlib-rv32gb-hello-world
```

Will let you use GDB to remotely debug the program. Use `target remote :2159` in GDB to connect:
```
(gdb) target remote :2159
Remote debugging using :2159
```

Once disconnected the emulator will continue as before, completing the program:

```
GDB is connected

>>> Program exited, exit code = 666 (0x29A)
```

## Binary translation

Binary translation is enabled with a CMake option. However, there are options to `build.sh` to simplify enabling it:

```sh
bash build.sh -x --bintr
```

In doing so, there are now more options available.

- `--timing` will display timing information from the binary translation process. The compilation process dominates heavily.
- `--trace` will make the translator embed tracing information, and print information to terminal for each translated instruction executed. It's a lot of logging.
- `--no-translate` will disable translation, and interpret the program instead.
- `--mingw ` is an experimental option that cross-compiles a Windows .dll for use on end-user systems. The .dll will appear in the current directory.

With binary translation enabled, we can now run a program. Let's try the 25600000th fibonacci number:

```sh
$ ./rvlinux -v ../binaries/measure_mips/fib
* Loading program of size 204 from 0x5e180b24ece0 to virtual 0x10000
* Program segment readable: 1 writable: 0  executable: 1
Emitted 22 accelerated instructions and 3 functions. GP=0x0
* Entry is at 0x10074
>>> Program exited, exit code = 3819729467 (0xE3AC723B)
Instructions executed: 1280000008  Runtime: 70.233ms  Insn/s: 18225mi/s
Pages in use: 4 (16 kB virtual memory, total 38 kB)
```

Quite fast! Without binary translation, it's a bit slower:

```sh
$ ./rvlinux --no-translate ../binaries/measure_mips/fib
>>> Program exited, exit code = 3819729467 (0xE3AC723B)
Instructions executed: 1280000008  Runtime: 1033.556ms  Insn/s: 1238mi/s
Pages in use: 4 (16 kB virtual memory, total 38 kB)
```

So it was ~15x faster with binary translation!


## Using TCC as JIT compiler

Binary translation with TCC is enabled with a CMake option. However, there are options to `build.sh` to simplify enabling it:

```sh
bash build.sh -x --tcc
```

With this option enabled, rvlinux will run programs almost instantly, but execute them faster than when in interpreter mode:

```sh
$ ./rvlinux ../binaries/measure_mips/fib
>>> Program exited, exit code = 3819729467 (0xE3AC723B)
Instructions executed: 1280000008  Runtime: 511.892ms  Insn/s: 2501mi/s
Pages in use: 4 (16 kB virtual memory, total 30 kB)
```

Exactly 2x faster than interpreted!
