		A sculpted prism primitive with advanced sculpting parameters.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		CSGSculptedPrism3D is a sculpted prism primitive that extends CSGSculptedPrimitive3D with prism-specific parameters. A prism is a 5-sided solid (box with one very small face). It supports all the sculpting parameters from the base class, allowing you to create complex parametric prism shapes.
		This node allows you to create a prism for use with the CSG system with advanced sculpting capabilities.
		[b]Note:[/b] CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a [MeshInstance3D] with a [PrimitiveMesh].
