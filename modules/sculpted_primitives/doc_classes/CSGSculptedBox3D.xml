		A sculpted box primitive with advanced sculpting parameters.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		CSGSculptedBox3D is a sculpted box primitive that extends CSGSculptedPrimitive3D with box-specific parameters. It supports all the sculpting parameters from the base class (path cuts, profile cuts, hollow, taper, twist, shear, etc.) allowing you to create complex parametric box shapes.
		This node allows you to create a box for use with the CSG system with advanced sculpting capabilities.
		[b]Note:[/b] CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a [MeshInstance3D] with a [PrimitiveMesh].
