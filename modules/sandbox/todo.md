Perfect! Let me create a detailed implementation plan to fix the sandbox initialization to be truly instance-based and eliminate the singleton patterns causing this crash.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Remove Static Initialization Barriers

**Target File: `modules/sandbox/src/sandbox_syscalls.cpp`**

1. **Remove the problematic static flag** (lines 1089-1095):

    - Delete `static bool initialized_before = false;`
    - Remove the early return that skips initialization
    - This ensures every sandbox instance properly initializes its syscalls

2. **Make syscall handler installation thread-safe**:
    - Add a static mutex for syscall handler registration
    - Use `std::call_once` or similar mechanism for one-time global handler setup
    - Separate one-time global setup from per-instance initialization

### Phase 2: Improve Dummy Machine Management

**Target File: `modules/sandbox/src/sandbox.cpp`**

1. **Replace global dummy_machine pointer** (lines 60, 152-161):

    - Convert to a proper singleton pattern with thread safety
    - Add proper initialization and cleanup
    - Ensure it's never accessed during destruction

2. **Add instance tracking for proper cleanup**:
    - Track active sandbox instances properly
    - Ensure dummy machine cleanup only happens when safe

### Phase 3: Instance-Based Syscall Management

**Target File: `modules/sandbox/src/sandbox_syscalls.cpp`**

1. **Split syscall initialization into two phases**:

    - **Global Phase**: One-time registration of syscall handlers (thread-safe)
    - **Instance Phase**: Per-instance machine setup and configuration

2. **Add proper exception safety**:
    - Wrap syscall initialization in try-catch
    - Ensure partial initialization is properly cleaned up
    - Reset instance state on initialization failure

### Phase 4: Thread Safety Improvements

**Target Files: `modules/sandbox/src/sandbox.h`, `modules/sandbox/src/sandbox.cpp`**

1. **Add mutex protection for shared resources**:

    - Protect static property names vector
    - Guard access to global statistics
    - Ensure thread-safe access to shared sandbox instances map

2. **Fix static initialization order issues**:
    - Ensure proper initialization order for static members
    - Add initialization guards where needed

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Remove singleton syscall initialization** - Each instance initializes properly
2. **Add thread safety** - Mutex protection for shared state
3. **Improve exception handling** - Proper cleanup on initialization failure
4. **Fix static member management** - Safe initialization and cleanup patterns

This approach will eliminate the race condition causing the segfault while maintaining performance and ensuring each sandbox instance has properly initialized syscalls.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these changes? I can start with the critical syscall initialization fix first, then move through the other improvements systematically.
