# Task 5: QA Testing for Direct Delta Mush Implementation

## Overview

This task focuses on comprehensive QA testing of the Direct Delta Mush (DDM)
implementation in Godot. The module is theoretically complete but requires
thorough validation to ensure production readiness, including compilation across
platforms, functional correctness, performance requirements, and visual quality
matching the Unity reference implementation.

  shaders, DirectDeltaMush node)
- ✅ Task 4: Integration & polish (editor integration, import pipeline,
  animation system compatibility)

**Module Status:**

- ✅ Full C++ implementation extending MeshInstance3D
- ✅ GPU compute shaders (GLSL) for performance-critical operations
- ✅ CPU fallbacks for compatibility
