# ExecuTorch Godot Integration - Pending Tasks

This document outlines the remaining tasks for integrating ExecuTorch machine learning inference capabilities into the Godot Engine.

## Build and Testing
- [ ] Build and test the integration within Godot engine context (no standalone SConstruct available)

## Code Integration
- [ ] Finalize ExecuTorch include integration after confirming build paths work correctly
- [ ] Implement proper tensor shape handling for different model types (currently simplified to 1D)
- [ ] Implement multiple input/output tensor support beyond single tensor forward pass

## Runtime Features
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and timing measurements
- [ ] Validate memory management and cleanup on shutdown
- [ ] Add error handling for malformed model files

## Testing and Demos
- [ ] Create demo scene/node that uses the runtime for actual model inference
- [ ] Test with real .pte (ExecuTorch) model files
