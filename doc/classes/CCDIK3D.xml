		Rotation based cyclic coordinate descent inverse kinematics solver.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[CCDIK3D] is rotation based IK, enabling fast and effective tracking even with large joint rotations. It's especially suitable for chains with rotation constraints, providing smoother and more stable target tracking compared to [FABRIK3D].
		[b]Note:[/b] When the target is close to the root, it can cause unnatural movements, including joint flips and oscillations.
