		A modification that moves two bones to reach the target.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This [SkeletonModification3D] uses an algorithm typically called TwoBoneIK. This algorithm works by leveraging the law of cosigns and the lengths of the bones to figure out what rotation the bones currently have, and what rotation they need to make a complete triangle, where the first bone, the second bone, and the target form the three vertices of the triangle. Because the algorithm works by making a triangle, it can only operate on two bones.
		TwoBoneIK is great for arms, legs, and really any joints that can be represented by just two bones that bend to reach a target. This solver is more lightweight than [SkeletonModification3DFABRIK], but gives similar, natural looking results.
		A [Node3D]-based node can be used to define the pole, or bend direction, allowing control over which direction the joint takes when bending to reach the target when the target is within reach.

		<member name="auto_calculate_joint_length" type="bool" setter="set_auto_calculate_joint_length" getter="get_auto_calculate_joint_length" default="false">
			Whether the TwoBoneIK modification will attempt to autocalculate the lengths of the two bones.

			If true, the TwoBoneIK modification will attempt to autocalculate the lengths of the bones being used. The first bone will be calculated by using the distance from the origin of the first bone to the origin of the second bone.
			The second bone will be calculated either using the tip node if that setting is enabled, or by using the distances of the second bone's children. If the tip node is not enabled and the bone has no children, then the length cannot be autocalculated. In this case, the length will either have to be manually inputted or a tip node used to calculate the length.

			Optional bone name that is being used as the pole node for the TwoBoneIK modification, if [member pole_node] is unset.

			When assigned, the TwoBoneIK modification will bend the bones in the direction towards this bone when the bones need to bend. This gives control over the direction the TwoBoneIK solver will bend, which is helpful for joints like elbows that only bend in certain directions.

			If set, the TwoBoneIK modification will attempt to use the tip bone to figure out the length and position of the tip of the second bone.
			[b]Note:[/b] The tip bone should generally be a child of the second bone, being offset so it is at the end of the bone.
