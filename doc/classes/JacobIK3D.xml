	<brief_description>
		Pseudo inverse Jacobian matrix based inverse kinematics solver.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[JacobIK3D] calculates rotations for all joints simultaneously, producing natural and smooth movements. It is particularly suited for realistic animations, such as humans or biological creatures.
		[b]Note:[/b] It converges more slowly than other IK solvers, leading to gentler and less immediate tracking of targets.
