	<description>
		[FABRIK3D] is position based IK, allowing precise and accurate tracking of targets. It's ideal for simple chains without rotation constraints.
		[b]Note:[/b] When the target is close to the root, it tends to produce zig-zag patterns, resulting in unnatural visual movement. Also with limitations, unreachable targets may cause oscillations and unstable results.
